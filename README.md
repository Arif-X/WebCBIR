# WebCBIR

This repo reffer from this <a href="https://github.com/ledleledle/CBIR">Repository</a> and i just convert it to some web. I'm using <a href="https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-dashboard-pro/">Argon Template</a> which its nice :) . Its just like google image search but i just showing 5 picture most relevant (hopefully most relevant with object). Like always... Its just a school project.

# Requirement
- Python 3.x
- virtualenv

Note : if you use <code>virtualenv</code> you don't need to install all the requirements, but if you using some local or cloud server like nginx or something, you must install all requirements!!!
-

# Requirement (if you're not using virtualenv)
- imuitils
- python-opencv
- numpy
- Pillow
- flask

Naaahhh... Just run <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

# Usage
- Go to cloned folder and activate <code>virtualenv</code>. Run <code>. venv/bin/activate</code>
- Then just run the python file <code>python runner.py</code>
- Open <code>localhost:5000</code> on your browser
- Enjoy
- If you want to update the dataset, Just do it from terminal (after you copy or change the images) run <code>python index-console.py</code>

FYI : if you got error when running this project, delete folder <code>venv</code> make new <code>virtualenv</code> and install all the requirements or just rename the project to <code>webcbir</code> lowercase! Or (again) run <code>virtualenv --relocatable</code> command on your terminal.

My method is, you upload the image, opencv and numpy process your image, system will save image to the temporary folder, showing the result, and the <code>app.route('/')</code> i use for checking the temporary folder is there exist or not. I will keep update this project and keep find the best method for best result. Hope you enjoy
