This repo reffer from this <a href="https://github.com/ledleledle/CBIR">Repository</a> and i just convert it to some web. I'm using <a href="https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-dashboard-pro/">Argon Template</a> which its nice :) . Its just like google image search but i just showing 5 picture most relevant (hopefully most relevant with object). Like always... Its just a school project.

- imuitils
- python-opencv
- numpy
- Pillow
- flask

# Usage
- Go to cloned folder and activate <code>virtualenv</code>. Run <code>. venv/bin/activate</code>

My method is, you upload the image, opencv and numpy process your image, system will save image to the temporary folder, showing the result, and the <code>app.route('/')</code> i use for checking the temporary folder is there exist or not. I will keep update this project and keep find the best method for best result. Hope you enjoy
